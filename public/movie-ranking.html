<p>The GOAT of anime movies. Everything from the art, soundtrack and vibes are just perfect. This will always be a classic and captures the essence of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki.</p>

<h3>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h3>

<p>Superb animation coupled with outstanding character writing and story direction. Miles' journey as the main character from a confused boy being thrown into shoes too large for him to fill, culminating in his leap of faith was just epic and that scene is one of the best ever created.</p>

<h3>Kung Fu Panda</h3>
